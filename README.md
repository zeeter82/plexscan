**powershell_plexscan.reg**  
  
  
  
  
This reg file can be used for right click shell options in Windows for scanning Plex  
content into their respective libraries. It takes advantage of PowerShell and Plex's  
URL command options - This seems to be a lot more stable and consistent than using   
the normal 'Plex Media Scanner.exe' command line options.  
  
  
  
  
This is a generic/sample file and needs to be configured for your setup/environment  
  
  
  
  
* Please update the Plex-Token with your unique token - replace `aaabbbccc111222333` 
with your own  
  
  
* Please update the text for how you would like the right click options to appear  
  
  
* Please update the sections with your correct library ID's
