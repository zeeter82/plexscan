##### This reg file can be used for right click shell options in Windows for scanning Plex  
##### content into their respective libraries. It takes advantage of PowerShell and Plex's  
##### URL command options - This seems to be a lot more stable and consistent than using  
##### the normal 'Plex Media Scanner.exe' command line options.

This is a sample reg file and needs to be configured for your setup/environment before merging.
